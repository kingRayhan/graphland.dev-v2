# Graphland Website Implementation Plan

A comprehensive step-by-step plan for implementing the Graphland website based on the design document in `plan.md`.

## Phase 1: Foundation & Setup

### 1. Analyze existing codebase structure and dependencies
- Review current Next.js structure and configuration
- Examine existing dependencies and build setup
- Understand GraphQL codegen configuration
- Identify any existing components or utilities

### 2. Set up GraphQL models and types for content management
- Define GraphQL schemas for website content
- Create types for services, products, projects, and team data
- Set up content management structure
- Configure GraphQL codegen for type safety

## Phase 2: Core Layout (using Tailwind CSS)

### 3. Create base layout structure with navigation and footer
- Implement sticky navigation bar with minimal design using Tailwind CSS
- Add navigation items: Home | Services | Products | Projects | About
- Create ultra-minimal footer with links and contact info
- Use Tailwind responsive utilities for mobile/desktop behavior

### 4. Implement hero section with typography and background effects
- Create full-width hero with large typography tagline using Tailwind typography classes
- Add clean background (white/light gray) with Tailwind color utilities
- Implement abstract geometric shapes or subtle motion effects with CSS animations
- Focus on typography hierarchy and spacing using Tailwind spacing utilities

## Phase 3: Content Sections

### 5. Build services section with minimal cards layout
- Create 3 full-width minimal cards
- Add icons/text for Website Development, Mobile App Development, Desktop Application Development
- Implement lots of whitespace and sharp typography
- Ensure cards are responsive

### 6. Create products showcase section with Apple-style highlights
- Design large product image/screenshot displays
- Add minimal descriptive text below products
- Implement Apple-style product highlighting
- Create smooth transitions between products

### 7. Develop projects grid with hover effects
- Build edge-to-edge visual grid layout
- Implement hover effects to reveal descriptions
- Optimize images for performance
- Ensure grid responsiveness

### 8. Build about section with centered content and team section
- Create clean centered text block about Graphland's mission
- Add minimal team headshots in grayscale style
- Focus on typography and content hierarchy
- Implement responsive text layout

## Phase 4: Polish & Integration

### 9. Implement responsive design for mobile and tablet
- Desktop: wide and airy layouts
- Mobile: stacked and simple layouts
- Tablet: hybrid approach with optimized spacing
- Test across different screen sizes

### 10. Add smooth animations and hover effects throughout
- Implement smooth fade-ins for content sections
- Add parallax scrolling effects
- Create hover reveals for interactive elements
- Ensure animations are performant and accessible

### 11. Integrate GraphQL data fetching for dynamic content
- Connect all sections to GraphQL data sources
- Implement data fetching strategies (SSG/SSR)
- Add loading states and error handling
- Optimize data queries for performance

### 12. Test and optimize performance across devices
- Run performance audits with Lighthouse
- Optimize images and assets
- Test loading times across different devices
- Ensure accessibility compliance

## Design Principles Reference

- **Minimalist & premium feel**: whitespace, sharp edges, high contrast
- **Typography-first design**: bold headlines, subtle body text
- **Animations**: smooth fade-ins, parallax scrolling, hover reveals
- **Responsive grid**: desktop = wide and airy, mobile = stacked and simple

## Technical Notes

- Content should be dynamically driven via GraphQL types from `/src/common/graphql-models/graphql.ts`
- Follow Apple.com inspiration for minimalism, whitespace usage, and elegance
- Strong focus on typography, spacing, and clean layout
- Subtle animations and hover effects for interactivity
