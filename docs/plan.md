Design a minimal and elegant website for Graphland, a software development agency specializing in custom solutions for websites, mobile apps, and desktop applications.

Style Reference:

Similar minimalism, whitespace usage, and elegance as Apple’s website (apple.com).

Strong focus on typography, spacing, and clean layout.

Subtle animations and hover effects for interactivity.

Structure:

Navigation bar (sticky, minimal): Home | Services | Products | Projects | About

Hero section:

Full-width, large typography tagline (e.g., “Custom solutions. Crafted with precision.”)

Clean background (white or very light gray)

Abstract geometric shapes or subtle motion effect behind text

Services section:

3 full-width minimal cards with icons/text for Website Development, Mobile App Development, Desktop Application Development

Lots of whitespace and sharp typography

Products section:

Showcase products with large product images/screenshots (Apple-style product highlight)

Minimal descriptive text below

Projects section:

Grid layout, edge-to-edge visuals

Hover effect to reveal short description

About section:

Clean centered text block about Graphland’s mission and expertise

Possibly include minimal team headshots in grayscale style

Footer:

Ultra-minimal with links, contact info, and copyright

Design Principles:

Minimalist & premium feel: whitespace, sharp edges, high contrast

Typography-first design: bold headlines, subtle body text

Animations: smooth fade-ins, parallax scrolling, hover reveals

Responsive grid: desktop = wide and airy, mobile = stacked and simple

Tech Note:

Content should be dynamically driven via GraphQL types from /src/common/graphql-models/graphql.ts.
